# Heaps

A heap is a tree structure that satisfies the **heap property**: each node is always either **less than (min heap)** or **greater than (max heap)** either of its children.

Typically a heap is implemented as an array, where the children of the node at index <code>i</code> are at indices `2 * i + 1` and `2 * i + 2`.

```typescript
class MinHeap {
  constructor() {
    this.heap = [];
  }
}
```

## Top K Elements Pattern

Find or manipulate the K largest/smallest elements in a collection.

## Merge K Sorted Pattern

Combine K sorted lists or arrays into a single sorted list.

## Two Heaps Pattern

Use two heaps to track median or balance elements in a stream.

## Sliding Window Median Pattern

Calculate median in a sliding window over a stream of numbers.

## Scheduling Pattern

Manage tasks or intervals using a heap for efficient scheduling.
