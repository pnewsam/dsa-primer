# Trees

## Overview

A tree is a branching data structure with a root node at the top and child nodes branching off of it. Usually, we are talking about binary trees, where each node has at most two children.

In Leetcode problems, you'll usually see binary trees represented as a list of nodes.

```typescript
class TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;

  constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
    this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
    this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
    this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
  }
}
```

As input, you'll receive the root node.

```typescript
function traverse(root: TreeNode | null) {
  // ...
}
```

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

  return 0;
}
```

## Tree Construction

**Problem**: [105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/)

```typescript
function myFunction(): number {
  return 0;
}
```
