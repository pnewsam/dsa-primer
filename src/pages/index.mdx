# DSA Primer

**Data Structures and Algorithms** is an essential subject for software engineers, and there is no shortage of learning materials out there. But it can be overwhelming sifting through it all. This **DSA Primer** expands on [this excellent reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1heiw94/ultimate_coding_interview_cheatsheet/) with examples and relevant problems and is meant to be a brief refresher on some of the most frequently tested patterns in technical interviews.

Each common pattern is paired with a single problem for 27 problems in total. It's significantly less than the [Leetcode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) or [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) problem sets. If you have the time, those problem sets may be worth your time. But given limited time, I believe you are best served by developing a stronger understanding of the core data stuctures and the most frequently-used algorithmic techniques, rather than memorizing a large number of problems.

It will in no way replace a proper university course, nor will it suffice to prepare you for a really rigorous interview. But if you&apos;re cramming last-minute, it might just give you enough wherewithal so that you don&apos;t make a fool of yourself when you&apos;re staring at a blank whiteboard.

## Additional Resources

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) is the go-to source of practice problems. If you are new to algorithm practice, [Leetcode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) is the standard recommendation. If you have more time, the [Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/) problem set is more comprehensive.

[Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) is in many ways the ideal resource for new learners. Rather than throwing you in the deep end, Navi provides a structured curriculum that exposes you to the core concepts before presenting related problems. He only goes as deep as is necessary for practical application.

If and when you have the time to develop a deeper conceptual understanding, [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms) offers excellent advice on how to approach it. And Oz Nova's newer project CS Primer provides a full course including a section on [algorithms](https://csprimer.com/courses/algorithms/). The content on problem-solving is especially helpful.
