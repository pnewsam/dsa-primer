# Arrays and Strings

## Overview

Arrays come in many varieties. But for the purposes of this section, we're talking about any ordered collection of elements whose elements can be accessed by index. Strings fit this definition. The techniques here are different methods for iterating over the elements efficiently to solve problems.

## Two Pointers

**Problem**: [Three Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

The two pointers technique uses two pointers that either start at different places or move in different directions or at different speeds in order to find a solution. (A **pointer** is a reference to an element in an array.)

```typescript
function myFunction(): number {
  return 0;
}
```

## Sliding Window

**Problem**: [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

```typescript
function myFunction(): number {
  return 0;
}
```

## Binary Search

**Problem**: [Search in a Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

```typescript
function myFunction(): number {
  return 0;
}
```

## Prefix Sum

**Problem**: [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

```typescript
function myFunction(): number {
  return 0;
}
```
